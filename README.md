- Add own recipes to recipe library
- Keep track of available ingredients
- Get recipe suggestions based on available ingredients
- Shopping list, from which you can directly add ingredients to storage
- Add items to shopping list from recipes

In some farway future these properties aswell:
- Image recognition to add items to storage from pictures of the materials or receipt
- Fetch and browse recipes from other online recipe sites

Done:

- Shopping list page, list with checkbox
- Added rest of the definitions for recipe (ingredients, amounts, instructions)
- Ingredients SQLite table and methods added
